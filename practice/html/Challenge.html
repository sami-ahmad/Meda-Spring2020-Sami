<P> <h2>Mars</h2> is the fourth <a href="planet"> </a>from the Sun and the second-smallest 
planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a 
name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'.
<sup>[15]</sup>
<sup>[16]</sup> The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars'
 surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the 
 astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.<sub>[17]</sub>
  Mars is a terrestrial 
 planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both 
 of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice 
 caps of Earth.
