<p>Sometimes i meet some friends which they don't know how to play then i am exmplaing like <br>"If you go first,
     hold your cue stick in one hand brace it on the table between the thubm and <br>index finger
of your other hand".pull the stick back smoothly, then slide it forward quickly <br>so it strikes the cue ball.
